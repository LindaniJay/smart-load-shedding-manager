# Smart Load Shedding Manager

This project aims to reduce energy waste and device damage during load shedding through smart IoT plugs and a mobile app for device prioritization and automation.

## MVP Scope
- 3-5 ESP32-based smart plugs (WiFi, relay, sensors)
- React Native mobile app for control, scheduling, and prioritization
- Firebase backend for real-time sync and device management

## Quick Start
- Firmware: ESP32 (Arduino framework)
- Mobile App: React Native
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Realtime Database)

## Directory Structure
- `/firmware` - ESP32 firmware
- `/app` - React Native mobile app
- `/backend` - Firebase backend setup
- `/docs` - Hardware sourcing and setup instructions

---

## Getting Started
1. See `/docs/hardware.md` for hardware sourcing and setup.
2. See `/firmware/` for ESP32 firmware installation.
3. See `/app/` for mobile app setup instructions.
4. See `/backend/` for Firebase backend configuration.
